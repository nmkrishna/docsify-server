Docsify Server
==============

## Getting Started

After clonging this repo, build the image by running:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

... then run the server with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should now be able to see the docsify site by going to the IP address or hostname of the server in your browser.

### Notes To Self
